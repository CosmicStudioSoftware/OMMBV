Welcome to OMMBV's documentation!
=================================

This documentation describes the Orthogonal Multi-pole Magnetic Basis Vectors
(OMMBV) module, which contains routines to derive a vector basis from any
magnetic field. These vectors may be used to organize electric field
measurements as well as map those electric fields along magnetic field lines
in a physically consistent manner.
