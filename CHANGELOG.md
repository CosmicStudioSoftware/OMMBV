## [1.0.1] - 2022-01-04
- Added pyproject.toml to support systems without numpy.

## [1.0.0] - 2021-12-24
- Updated vector basis algorithm and reduced uncertainty when 
scaling ion drifts and electric fields for multipole fields by four orders of magnitude.
- Added support for multiple unit test magnetic fields, from dipole up to octupole. 
- Added support for testing vector basis determination with a spherical Earth.
- Improved tolerance checks on vector basis during iteration so outputs better
reflect user settings.
- Improved robustness of vector basis calculation at higher latitudes.
- Updated IGRF step method to slow integration when reaching target altitude
  to use user provided step size.
- Allow automatic expansion of `field_line_trace` step_size after many iterations.
- Improved robustness of `apex_location_info` to unreported changes in 
`field_line_trace` step_size.
- Added `pole_tol` keyword which specifies how close to vertical local
  magnetic field must be to be considered a pole.
- Added `utils.datetimes_to_doubles` a method to calculate year and 
  fractional day of year for IGRF calls.
- Added keyword `max_steps` to `apex_location_info`
- Corrected normalization error in `magnetic_vector`.
- Deprecated `scalar` input for basis vectors.
- Reduced number of allowed recursive calls for `field_line_trace`
- Moved vector functions to `OMMBV.vector`
- Moved transformation functions to `OMMBV.trans`
- Moved tracing functions to `OMMBV.trace`
- Moved older algorithms not needed for current outputs to `OMMBV.heritage`
- Moved supporting Fortran functions from `OMMBV.igrf13` to `OMMBV.sources`
- Improved robustness of `apex_location_info` to `full_field_line` tracing failures.
- Added support for GitHub Workflows
- Refactored unit testing
- Moved to `setup.cfg`
- Added `.zenodo.json`
- Improved documentation
- Updated docstrings
